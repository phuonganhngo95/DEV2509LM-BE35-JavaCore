The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, Object, localized characters, etc.
A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read data from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.
Java provides strong but flexible support for I/O related to Files and networks but this tutorial covers very basic functionality related to streams and I/O. We would see most commonly used example one by one:
Byte Streams
Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are , FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Following is an example which makes use of these two classes to copy an input file into an output file:
